To get the latest build you'll have to compile the source code manually. It takes some time and that's exactly why I'm not releasing stable builds all the time.

Watch video tutorial! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o_Mcgjk3a4

or just read it..
	1) Install Java Development Kit (may work without it, try and you'll see)
	2) Create new folder (anywhere), open it
	3) Download the source code (https://github.com/fisty256/AFFS/archive/master.zip)
	4) Extract source code into the folder
	5) Hold Shift and Right-click in the folder, click "Open command window here"
	6) Type "gradlew build"
	7) After about one minute the process should be completed, you can find the mod in build/libs

If you have any problems compiling the source code, tweet me @Fisty256!
